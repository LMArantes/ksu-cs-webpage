import streamlit as st

st.markdown("""##### **Checking Out a Working Copy**
```sh
svn checkout http://www.foo.edu/svn/oop/username
svn co http://www.foo.edu/svn/oop/username
```
Checks out a working copy from the repository. Normally, do this only once or 
when something is messed up and you need a fresh copy from the server.

##### **Updating Your Working Copy**
```sh
svn update
```
Brings your working copy up-to-date with the server repository. Any changes made in the 
repository are put into your working copy. Always do this before you start working on a file (or repo).

##### **Adding Files to Version Control**
```sh
svn add filename
```
Puts the file `filename` under control of the versioning system. Do this once when you create a new file or folder.

##### **Committing Changes**
```sh
svn commit -m "Added new method."
svn ci -m "Added new method."
```
Commits the changes that you have made to the working copy to the server repository with a comment. Do this every time you stop working on a file.

##### **Checking Status**
```sh
svn status
```
Gives the status of all files in the current versioned directory/folder. Indicates if files are under version control or modified.
- `?` - File is not under version control. You may have forgotten to do an `svn add`.
- `M` - File is modified. You will need to do a commit.

##### **Deleting Files**
```sh
svn delete filename
```
Deletes the file `filename`. Only occurs in the working copy, i.e., must be committed to show up in the repository.

##### **Moving or Renaming Files**
```sh
svn mv oldfilename newfilename
```
Changes the name of a file from `oldfilename` to `newfilename`. Only occurs in the working copy, i.e., must be committed to show up in the repository.

##### **Creating a New Directory**
```sh
svn mkdir directory_filename
```
Creates a new directory with the name `directory_filename`. Only occurs in the working copy, i.e., must be committed to show up in the repository.

##### **Renaming a Directory**
```sh
svn mv old_directory new_directory
```
Changes the name of the directory from `old_directory` to `new_directory`. Make sure to commit any work and perform an update first to avoid problems. Only occurs in the working copy, i.e., must be committed to show up in the repository.

##### **Viewing Log History**
```sh
svn log filename
```
Presents information about the various versions of `filename`. Can be used to find the version number that corresponds to a version that you may want.

##### **Reverting to a Previous Version**
```sh
svn update filename -r####
```
If you want to move back to a previous version, use `update` with the `-r` option. Get the version number from `svn log filename` and replace `####` with it.
